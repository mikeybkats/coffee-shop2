The ability to forecast the expected 
customers per hour at each location,
plus a daily total,
by entering her projected minimum-vs.-maximum customers/hour into a form

Her market analysis has given some information as a starting point: the expected minimum and maximum number of customers per hour at each location, and the average amounts of cups and beans purchased by customers at each location

Those numbers will help Jo to plan the amount of warm beans to be delivered to each kiosk each morning, and also help her calculate staffing needs

The total amount of beans sold at each location is a combination of the cups of coffee sold (1 pound of beans makes 16 cups), plus the to-go pounds that are sold.

Some locations, such as the Seattle Public Library and Capitol Hill, will tend to sell more cups than pounds, whereas others, such as Pike Place Market and Sea-Tac Airport, will tend to sell more pounds to tourists.
